All PCjs machines are built from the following sets of devices:
 
* [6502 Devices](c1p/): [Challenger 1P](c1p/machine/)
* [8080 Devices](pc8080/): [Space Invaders](pc8080/machine/invaders/), [VT100 Terminal](pc8080/machine/vt100/)
* [8086 Devices](pcx86/): [IBM PC and compatibles](pcx86/machine/)
* [PDP-10 Devices](pdp10/): [PDP-10 (Model KA10)](pdp10/machine/ka10/)
* [PDP-11 Devices](pdp11/): [PDP-11/20](pdp11/machine/1120/), [PDP-11/45](pdp11/machine/1145/), [PDP-11/70](pdp11/machine/1170/)

These devices are user-installable components that you would typically find in a real personal computer,
such as keyboards, disk drive controllers with one or more drives, video cards, etc.
