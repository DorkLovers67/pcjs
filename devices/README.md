Device Configurations
---

All PCjs machines are built from the following sets of devices:
 
* [6502 Devices](c1p/) (e.g., [Challenger 1P](c1p/machine/))
* [8080 Devices](pc8080/) (e.g., [Space Invaders](pc8080/machine/invaders/), [VT100 Terminal](pc8080/machine/vt100/))
* [8086 Devices](pcx86/) (e.g., [IBM PC and compatibles](pcx86/machine/))
* [PDP-11 Devices](pdp11/) (e.g., [PDP-11/70](pdp11/machine/1170/))

These devices are user-installable components that you would typically find in a real personal computer,
such as keyboards, disk drive controllers with one or more drives, video cards, etc.
