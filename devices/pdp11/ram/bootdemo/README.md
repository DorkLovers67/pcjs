PDP-11 Boot Demo
----------------

[BOOTDEMO.MAC](bootdemo.mac) is based on [BOOT.MAC](http://skn.noip.me/pdp11/boot.mac) written by [Paul Nankervis](mailto:paulnank@hotmail.com))

[BOOTDEMO.MAC](bootdemo.mac) was cross-assembled with [MACRO11](https://github.com/shattered/macro11) to produce [BOOTDEMO.LST](bootdemo.lst),
which was then processed by [FileDump](/modules/filedump/) to produce [BOOTDEMO.JSON](bootdemo.json).
