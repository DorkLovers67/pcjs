PDP-11/45 Machine Configurations
--------------------------------

PDPjs supports a variety of PDP-11/45 machine configurations, including:

* [PDP-11/45 with Front Panel](/devices/pdp11/machine/1145/panel/) (with [Debugger](/devices/pdp11/machine/1145/panel/debugger/))
* [PDP-11/45 with VT100 Terminal](/devices/pdp11/machine/1145/vt100/) (with [Debugger](/devices/pdp11/machine/1145/vt100/debugger/))

All of the above configurations include 248Kb of RAM -- the maximum supported by the PDP-11/45 architecture.
The top 8Kb of the PDP-11/45's 18-bit address space is occupied by the *I/O Page*, a region reserved for hardware
registers belonging to the CPU, MMU, and assorted peripherals.
