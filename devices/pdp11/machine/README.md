PDP-11 Machine Configurations
-----------------------------

[PDP-11 Devices](/devices/pdp11/) are used to build a variety of PDP-11 machines, including:

* [PDP-11/20](/devices/pdp11/machine/1120/)
* [PDP-11/45](/devices/pdp11/machine/1145/)
* [PDP-11/70](/devices/pdp11/machine/1170/)

Most machine configurations come in two flavors: with or without the built-in PCjs Debugger.

For example, the [PDP-11/70 with Front Panel](/devices/pdp11/machine/1170/panel/) is also available as
the [PDP-11/70 with Front Panel and Debugger](/devices/pdp11/machine/1170/panel/debugger/), which includes a section
on "[Toggle-Ins](/devices/pdp11/machine/1170/panel/debugger/#toggle-ins)" for your switch-toggling enjoyment.
