DEC PDP-11/20 Publications
---

- PDP-11/20 Handbook (1969) [[PDF](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/Digital/PDP%2011%20Handbook%201969.pdf)]
- PDP-11/20 Handbook (1971) [[PDF](http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp11/handbooks/PDP1120_Handbook_1972.pdf)]

The above publications actually apply to several PDP-11 models:

- PDP-11/10, which provided a minimum of 128 words of read/write memory (and 1024 words of read-only memory)
- PDP-11/20, which provided a minimum of 4,096 words of read-write memory

The 1971 Handbook also covers some additional models, which DEC says were "functionally identical":

- PDP-11/15 OEM Computer
- PDP-11R20 Rugged Computer
