RK03 (or more precisely, RK03-KA) disks are single-platter cartridges with a capacity of 2.38Mb.
They are used in RK05 disk drives in conjunction with an [RK11 Disk Controller](/devices/pdp11/rk11/).

RL01K and RL02K disks are single-platter cartridges with capacities of 5Mb and 10Mb, respectively,
They are used in RL01 and RL02 disk drives with an [RL11 Disk Controller](/devices/pdp11/rl11/).
