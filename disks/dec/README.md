DEC Disk Images
---------------

The DEC disk images we have archived are organized by type: 

* RL01K
* [RL02K](rl02k/)

RL01K and RL02K disks are both single-platter cartridges with capacities of 5Mb and 10Mb, respectively,
and are designed to be used with an [RL11 Disk Controller](/devices/pdp11/rl11/).
