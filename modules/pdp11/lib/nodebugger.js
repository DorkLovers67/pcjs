 * WARNING: DEBUGGER needs to accurately reflect whether or not the Debugger component is (or will be) loaded.
 * In the compiled case, we rely on the Closure Compiler to override DEBUGGER as appropriate.  When it's *false*,
 * nearly all of debugger.js will be conditionally removed by the compiler, reducing it to little more than a
 * "type skeleton", which also solves some type-related warnings we would otherwise have if we tried to remove
 * debugger.js from the compilation process altogether.
 *
 * However, when we're in "development mode" and running uncompiled code in debugger-less configurations,
 * I would still like to skip loading debugger.js altogether.  To do that, we must arrange for this additional file,
 * nodebugger.js, to be loaded immediately after defines.js, *explicitly* overriding the previously defined value
 * of DEBUGGER with *false*.
