     * Called whenever the VT100 ChipSet circuit needs the Keyboard UART's transmitter status.
     *
     * From p. 4-32 of the VT100 Technical Manual (July 1982):
     *
     *      The operating clock for the keyboard interface comes from an address line in the video processor (LBA4).
     *      This signal has an average period of 7.945 microseconds. Each data byte is transmitted with one start bit
     *      and one stop bit, and each bit lasts 16 clock periods. The total time for each data byte is 160 times 7.945
     *      or 1.27 milliseconds. Each time the Transmit Buffer Empty flag on the terminal's UART gets set (when the
     *      current byte is being transmitted), the microprocessor loads another byte into the transmit buffer. In this
     *      way, the stream of status bytes to the keyboard is continuous.
     *
     * We used to always return true (after all, what's wrong with an infinitely fast UART?), but unfortunately,
     * the VT100 firmware relies on the UART's slow transmission speed to drive cursor blink rate.  We have several
     * options:
     *
     *      1) Snapshot the CPU cycle count each time a byte is transmitted (see outVT100UARTStatus()) and then every
     *      time this is polled, see if the cycle count has exceeded the snapshot value by the necessary threshold;
     *      if we assume 361.69ns per CPU cycle, there are 22 CPU cycles for every 1 LBA4 cycle, and since transmission
     *      time is supposed to last for 160 LBA4 cycles, the threshold is 22*160 CPU cycles, or 3520 cycles.
     *
     *      2) Set a CPU timer using the new setTimer() interface, which can be passed the number of milliseconds to
     *      wait before firing (in this case, roughly 1.27ms).
     *
     *      3) Call the ChipSet's getVT100LBA(4) function for the state of the simulated LBA4, and count 160 LBA4
     *      transitions; however, that would be the worst solution, because there's no guarantee that the firmware's
     *      UART polling will occur regularly and/or frequently enough for us to catch every LBA4 transition.
     *
     * I'm going with solution #1 because it's less overhead.

 * First, if we have a binding to the machine's "screen", there will, at a minimum, be onkeydown and onkeyup

 * for key codes that we care about and converting them to corresponding soft codes.  Some machines, like
 * Space Invaders, will then act directly upon the soft code (eg, converting it to a machine-specific status bit).
 *
 * Second, a machine may have other bindings (eg, buttons) to one or more of these soft codes, and those bindings
 * will need to know which key codes they're supposed to generate.  Some machines, like the VT100, will then use
 * another table (KEYMAP) to convert key codes into a machine-specific "key addresses".
