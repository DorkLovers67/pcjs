DEC PDP-11 Absolute Loader
--------------------------

The Absolute Loader is a special tape image that must be loaded in order to load *other* tapes
which use the Absolute Loader format.

To see the Absolute Loader in action, try the [Bootstrap Loader Demo](/devices/pdp11/machine/1120/bootstrap/debugger/).
