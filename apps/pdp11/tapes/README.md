DEC PDP-11 Tape Images
----------------------

We have archived the following DEC PDP-11 Tapes:

- [Absolute Loader](absloader/)
- [BASIC (Single User)](basic/)

along with a copy of the [DEC PDP-11 Bootstrap Loader](/apps/pdp11/boot/bootstrap/), which is required if you actually want
to load any of the above tapes into memory using the [PC11 High-Speed Paper Tape Reader/Punch](/devices/pdp11/pc11/).

For the most part, the tapes we have archived are in the DEC "Absolute Format".  More information about that format
is on the [Absolute Loader](absloader/) page.

DEC Paper Tape Software (circa 1971)
------------------------------------

As documented in the [PDP-11/20 Handbook (1971)](http://archive.pcjs.org/pubs/dec/pdp11/1120/PDP1120_Handbook_1971.pdf),
p. 155, "PAPER TAPE SOFTWARE", the following software was available on paper tape:

- PAL-11A ASSEMBLER
- PAL-11S ASSEMBLER (Program Assembly Language for the PDP-11, Relocatable Version)
- ED-11 (Text Editor program)
- DUMPTT (Dump Octal)
- DUMPAB (Dump Absolute Binary Code)
- FPP-11 (Floating-Point and Math Package for the PDP-11)
- ODT-11 (On-line Debugging Technique for the PDP-11)
- IOX (PDP-11 Input/Output eXecutive)
- PDP-11 BASIC (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)

There was a separate DEC publication, [PDP-11 Paper Tape Software Handbook](http://archive.pcjs.org/pubs/dec/pdp11/other/DEC-11-XPTSA-B-D_PDP-11_Paper_Tape_Software_Handbook.pdf),
that described all of the above software in greater detail, and it included some programs that the 1971 Handbook listed under
"Disk Operating System" instead of "Paper Tape System", such as:

- LINK-11S LINKER

Thanks to the [iamvirtual.ca](http://iamvirtual.ca/PDP-11/PTS-11/PTS-11.htm) website, most of the above programs are
available as paper tape image files, with the exception of PAL-11S and LINK-11S:
