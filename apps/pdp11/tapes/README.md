PDP-11 Software Tapes
---------------------

The initial PDP-11 software we are working on supporting includes:

- [Absolute Loader](DEC-11-L2PC-PO.json)
- [BASIC (Single User)](DEC-11-AJPB-PB.json)

To make it easy for PDPjs machines to load these applications, we provide the following High-Speed
Paper Tape Reader (PC11) configuration files:

- [samples.xml](samples.xml)

These configuration files create UI controls that allow you to choose from a set of tapes that are automatically sent
to the machine's PC11 device.
