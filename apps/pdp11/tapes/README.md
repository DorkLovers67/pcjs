DEC PDP-11 Tapes
----------------

We have archived the following DEC PDP-11 Tapes:

- [Absolute Loader](DEC-11-L2PC-PO.json)
- [BASIC (Single User)](DEC-11-AJPB-PB.json)

To make it easy for PDPjs machines to load these tapes, we created the following High-Speed
Paper Tape Reader (PC11) configurations:

- [demo.xml](demo.xml)

These configuration files create UI controls that allow you to choose from a set of tapes that are automatically sent
to the machine's PC11 device.
