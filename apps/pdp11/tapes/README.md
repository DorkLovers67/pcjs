DEC PDP-11 Tape Images
----------------------

We have archived the following DEC PDP-11 Tapes:

- [Absolute Loader](absloader/)
- [BASIC (Single User)](basic/)

along with a copy of the [DEC PDP-11 Bootstrap Loader](/apps/pdp11/boot/bootstrap/), which is required if you actually want
to load any of the above tapes into memory using the [PC11 High-Speed Paper Tape Reader/Punch](/devices/pdp11/pc11/).

For the most part, the tapes we have archived are in the DEC Absolute Loader format.  More information about that format
is on the [Absolute Loader](absloader/) page.
