PDP-10 KLAD Diagnostics
-----------------------

PCjs has archived selected files from
[PDP-10 KLAD Diagnostics Sources](http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/klad_sources/index.html) and turned them into
stand-alone PDP-10 diagnostics, using the new PCjs [MACRO-10 Mini-Assembler](/modules/pdp10/lib/macro10.js).  A complete
list is provided [below](#list-of-ka10-diagnostics).

I experimented with assembling an entire diagnostic (**DAKAK**) from all its original pieces, by going to the
[DAKAK Diagnostic](dakak/) page and typing the following command:

	a 'dakakt.mac;../param.klm;../fixed.klm;dakakm.mac;../uuoerr.klm;../stor.klm'

and while the MACRO-10 assembly process works:

	loading dakakt.mac
	loading param.klm
	loading fixed.klm
	loading dakakm.mac
	loading uuoerr.klm
	loading stor.klm

	030000: 254020 027776  JRST    @27776

there are additional modules that must be loaded into the machine as well, which are not yet supported.  So it's best
to assemble the modified files that I've placed inside each diagnostic's folder.  For the [DAKAK Diagnostic](dakak/),
that's **DAKAK.MAC**: 

	>> a dakak.mac
	loading dakak.mac

	04=000000000000 05=000000000000 06=000000000000 07=000000000000

	14=000000000000 15=000000000000 16=000000000000 17=000000000000

	030621: 254000 030622  JRST    30622

If the machine is able to run to the end of the diagnostic (which can be located by looking at the diagnostic's original
MACRO-10 listing file) without stopping on an UUO opcode, then you can assume it passed.
